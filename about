      <h4> 
        Hi! My name is Gianna Paroline and this is my AP CSP Website Portfolio. <h4> 
   
       <h4> To tell you a little about myself, I am 16 years old and a junior at Westview High School. I am currently taking AP CSP, Photography 3/4, and American Lit. Next year as a senior I will be taking AP Psychology, AP Photography, Civics/gov, and EXPOS.
         <h4> 
           
  Within Westview, I am apart of the Body Image Task Force club, and on Varisty Lacrosse and Field Hockey. Outside of school I have played competitive soccer for 11 years. I also am very passionate about photography, fashion, and my little puppy, Lulus.
